You must create a new directory, outside of the tomcat directory, for this purpose.
The user that runs Tomcat must have read/write privileges for this directory.
Subdirectories that will be created by ERDDAP are:
* datasetInfo (which some datasets use to cache information about the dataset
   to speed up reloading the dataset in the future),
* flag (where you can put a file with a datasetID's name to force reloading of
   that dataset) and
* cache (which ERDDAP uses to hold cached data files - ERDDAP periodically
   removes files older than cacheMinutes (see below)).
The ERDDAP log file (log.txt) will be put in this directory.

ERDDAP's to subscribe to datasets on your ERDDAP).

If you don't want your ERDDAP to send emails, change the emailSmtpHost tag
contents to be nothing.

It is a security risk to put your email password in a plain text file like this.
To mitigate that problem, we strongly remommend that you:
1) Set up an email account just for ERDDAP's use, e.g.,
   erddap@yourInstitution.org
   That has other benefits as well: more than one ERDDAP administrator can then
   be given access to that email account.
2) Make the permissions of this setup.xml file rw (read+write) for the user who
   will run Tomcat and ERDDAP (user=tomcat?) and no permissions (not read or
   write) for the group and other users.

emailProperties is a list of additional properties in the form
  prop1|value1|prop2|value2
The default is nothing.

If possible, set this up to use a secure connection (SSL / TLS) to the email server.

For gmail (even your.name@noaa.gov accounts which are managed by Google),
  for emailSmtpHost, use smtp.gmail.com
  for emailSmtpPort, use 587
  for emailProperties, use mail.smtp.starttls.enable|true

are logged to an emailLogYEAR-MONTH.txt file in [bigParentDirectory]/logs/.

If you can't get ERDDAP to send emails (error = "Connection refused")

In general, only image files are cached, because the same images are often

Although it might seem like a given request should always return the same

No matter what, each dataset won't be reloaded more often than its
reloadEveryNMinutes value as specified in datasets.xml.

The only disadvantage to setting this to a smaller number is that
it will increase the frequency that ERDDAP retries datasets that aren't
loading. If there are lots of such datasets and they are retested frequently,
the data source might consider it pestering/aggressive behaviour.

<h1>Welcome!</h1>
This ERDDAP server contains a variety of datasets related to Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island Sound, and surrounding regions of the ocean. Our goal is to try to provide a holistic picture of the waters around Rhode Island by including a variety of different types of data. Here you will find physical oceanographic data such as sea surface temperature, salinity, and currents, and atmospheric data including pressure, wind, and wind stress, as well as numerous biological variables. Ultimately, we would like to start including output from the Ocean State Ocean Model (OSOM), which has been developed by URI and Brown Collaborators based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). If you are looking to make comparisons between OSOM output and observational data, it may be  helpful to note that OSOM only models a region within latitudes 40.50714925503489°N to 42.17423565201304°N and longitudes -72.66539077917145°W to -69.9851266704007°W. Some of the gridded datasets have global data, so slicing by latitude and longitude may be useful if you are looking at a specific area.
<h2>What kinds of data can I explore here?</h2>
This server includes both gridded and tabular datasets. To browse all of our datasets, <a href="https://pricaimcit.services.brown.edu/erddap/info/index.html?page=1&itemsPerPage=1000">click here to view a list of datasets</a> (the number of datasets will change as we grow this resource). If you are interested in one particular dataset or type of data, take advantage of the search bar.
<h2>Overview of Tabular Datasets</h2>
Buoy data is tabular, and there are buoy datasets for temperature, salinity, wind speed, wave height, plankton, turbidity, etc. If you are looking for a long time series of temperature or salinity, consider looking at the Global Temperature and Salinity Profile Program data (Dataset ID: erdGtsppBest), which goes back to 1985. Another particularly helpful buoy dataset for physical variables is the National Data Buoy Center Standard Meteorological Buoy Data (Dataset ID: cwwcNDBCMet), which has data points at 10 minute intervals going back to 1970. For biological or biogeochemical data at multiple depths, see the Plankton Time series (Dataset ID:  plankton_time_series_7615_c513_ef8e) or the RI Buoy Data (Dataset ID: combined_e784_bee5_492e).
<h2>Overview of Gridded Datasets</h2>
Satellite data and model output are gridded. For physical atmospheric data, see the Navy Global Environmental Model datasets or the NOAA/NCDC Blended sea winds datasets. There is also one dataset for geostrophic currents (Dataset ID: miamicurrents), one for sea surface height (Dataset ID: erdTAssh1day), and two for topography (Dataset IDs: etopo180 and etopo360). For sea surface temperature, see the Multi-Scale Ultra-high Resolution Analysis (Dataset ID: jplMURSST41) or the GHRSST sea surface temperature data (Dataset ID: jplG1SST). These sea surface temperature datasets are very large, and working with them will require significant computing power and/or careful slicing of the data. We also have a variety of datasets relating to plankton from the MODIS and Suomi-NPP/VIIRS satellites instruments. MODIS data is from 2003 to present, while Suomi-NPP/VIIRS is from 2012 to present. Both the MODIS and Suomi-NPP/VIIRS data include chlorophyll a, the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm, and photosynthetically available radiation. A few other variables are included for one satellite but not the other.
